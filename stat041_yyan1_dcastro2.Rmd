## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r dataset}
library(fivethirtyeight)
college <- data.frame(college_recent_grads)
college_fed <- read_csv("~/stat041/labs/stat041_p1_grp14/labor-market-for-recent-college-grads.csv")
```
